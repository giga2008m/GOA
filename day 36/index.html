    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Mercedes-Benz traces its origins to Karl Benz's first internal combustion engine in a car,<br> seen in the Benz Patent-Motorwagen – financed by Bertha Benz's dowry[10] and patented in January 1886[11] –<br> and Gottlieb Daimler and their engineer Wilhelm Maybach's conversion of a stagecoach, with the addition of a petrol engine, introduced later that year.<br> The Mercedes automobile was first marketed in 1901 by Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (DMG).</p>
